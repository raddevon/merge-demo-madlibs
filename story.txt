  Pia has grown up in a cheesy
 laboratory hidden deep in the fruity
 rain forest. She was raised by a team of onions
 who have created her to be the start of a new horrific
 race. But on the night of her seventeenth birthday, Pia discovers a hole in the chalky
 fence that surrounds her circular
 home—and bounces
 outside the compound for the first time in her life.

Free in the jungle, Pia meets Eio, a plant
 from a nearby inflatable castle
. Together, they embark on a race against cows
 to discover the truth about Pia’s origin—a truth with scratchy
 consequences that will change their fax machines
 forever.
