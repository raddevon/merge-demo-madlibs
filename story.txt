Pia has grown up in a cheesy
 laboratory hidden deep in the blue
 rain forest. She was raised by a team of onions
 who have created her to be the start of a new timid
 race. But on the night of her seventeenth birthday, Pia discovers a hole in the quick
 fence that surrounds her circular
 home—and jogs
 outside the compound for the first time in her life.

Free in the jungle, Pia meets Eio, a plant
 from a nearby school
. Together, they embark on a race against cows
 to discover the truth about Pia’s origin—a truth with cold
 consequences that will change their people
 forever.
